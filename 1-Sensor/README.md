**Software:**

- Arduino IDE or [Arduino Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/arduino-makefile) to compile code.
- [HCSR04](https://github.com/Martinsos/arduino-lib-hc-sr04) library by Martin Šošić.

**Hardware:**

- **1**X Arduino UNO or Arduino Nano;
- **1**X Ultrassonic sensor (HC-SR04);
- Jumpers connectors;
- **1**X 3.3V Buzzer;
- **1**X DC Motor for vibration (Optional).

**Sugestions of things to use as a walkstick (thats we recommend):**

- Traditional walkstick for blind people;
- Tree stick (Why not?);
- Sefie stick.

The stick you can use and do anything you want, thats mean if you want to add 
something in your project you are free to do it, this is the real meaning
of Open Source, the future is adapt to every needs.

## Building
First you need to build the follow scheme:

after this upload the `1-Sensor.ino` file to your Arduino using the IDE
and done!
